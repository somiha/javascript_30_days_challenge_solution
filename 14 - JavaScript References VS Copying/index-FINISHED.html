      const team = players;
      console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
      //team[3]='Lux';
      
    // however what happens when we update that array?
      
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      const team2 = players.slice();
      const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // one way
      const team4 = [...players];
      team[5]= 'a b';
      
      const team5 = Array.from(players);
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
      const captain = person;
      captain.number = 99;
    // how do we take a copy instead?
      const cap2 = Object.assign({},person,{number: 99});
      console.log(cap2)
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      //const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
